Capstone-Project_-Prediction-of-Unified-Parkinson-s-Disease-Rating-Scale-UPDRS-with-voice-measures-

Problem Definition:

The task is to predict the motor and total UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) scores using voice data. UPDRS is an essential metric for assessing the progression of Parkinson's disease. Accurate prediction of these scores from non-invasive voice tests could assist in remote monitoring of the disease.

Objectives:

Input: 16 voice measures such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio.
Target: Predict motor_UPDRS and total_UPDRS (continuous variables).
Goal: Develop regression models to predict these scores for early detection and tracking of Parkinson's disease severity.
